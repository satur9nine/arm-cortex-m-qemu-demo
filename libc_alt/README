Contained within libc_alt are additions and replacements to the chosen libc 
implementation for this project: newlib-nano.

Newlib-nano is included in the arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain but is lacking:
 * Sub-optimal performance memory routines: memcpy, memcmp, memset, strcpy, etc
 * Missing some valuable POSIX routines: timegm, htonl, ntohl, etc

Note we keep the directory structure of the originating project but just copy 
the files we desire. Keeping the directory structure allows diffing newer 
releases to see what fixes/improvements have been made.
