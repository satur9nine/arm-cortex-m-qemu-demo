# ARM Cortex-M QEMU Demo

This project contains source that demostrates the use of a variety of software
I find useful in embedded projects:

 * FreeRTOS
 * CmBacktrace
 * Newlib-nano with malloc and printf implemented
 * Selected faster C standard library routines from Newlib (non-nano) and MUSL

TODO
 * Add CMSIS

The target device is the Stellaris LM3S6965 run from QEMU so no physical hardware is needed.
